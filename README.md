scala-torrent
=============

As a personal challenge I decided to create a [BitTorrent](http://www.bittorrent.com) client in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org). I chose this topic for two primary reasons:

* To explore new topics and problems aside from the iOS and web development projects I'm doing.
* To gain more experience with Scala and especially [Akka](http://akka.io), as the subject should be a good fit for the [actor model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model).

To make things more interesting, I do intend to only use at the specification of the protocol and shall not study any existing implementation in any language.

As a general timeframe I am planning to finish the basic functionality by the end of May 2014. Depending on time and interest I will then decide if I am continuing with the project or not.
